```bash
git git@github.com:EMMS2025-Perovskite/EMMS2025-One-Year-Project-Perovskite.git
cd EMMS2025-One-Year-Project-Perovskite
```

2. Make changes to `.tex` files

3. Use these Git commands:

```bash
git pull             # get the latest changes from the server
git add .            # stage all your changes
git commit -m "short message"  # save a snapshot
git push             # upload your changes
```

#### If you're using Codespaces – Git is integrated in the browser

You can use the Git panel or the terminal in Codespaces without installing anything.
