\section{Mission Statement}

The space sector's growing demand for extended missions depends on durable, long-lived power systems. However, traditional silicon-based solar panels degrade over time, limiting their effectiveness. Recent terrestrial experiments with perovskite-based solar cells have demonstrated promising self-healing properties. If these capabilities can be validated under space conditions, perovskite solar cells could revolutionise energy supply in space by enhancing reliability and reducing costs.

Ultimately, this mission aims to quantify both the degradation and the self-healing behaviour of perovskite photovoltaic materials in the space environment. Demonstrating their performance in orbit is a critical step toward establishing perovskites as a next-generation power source, one that supports longer, more energy-efficient space missions and meets the growing demands of modern space systems.
